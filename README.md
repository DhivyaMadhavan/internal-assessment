# Full-Stack Engineering Intern Assessment
## API Multiplexer with Custom Circuit Breaker, Real-Time Dashboard & Chaos Testing

---

## Overview

This project implements a resilient API Multiplexer built using **Go**, **React**, **Docker**, and **WebSockets**.

The application acts as a reverse proxy that routes incoming client requests to a **Primary API**. When the Primary API becomes unavailable or exceeds a **200 ms timeout**, a custom-built **Circuit Breaker** automatically redirects requests to a **Secondary API** without dropping the client request.

The frontend provides a real-time monitoring dashboard displaying circuit breaker state transitions, request statistics, routing information, and telemetry streamed over WebSockets.

# Features

## Backend (Go)

- Custom HTTP Reverse Proxy using Go standard library (`net/http`)
- Custom Circuit Breaker implementation (no external resilience libraries)
- Thread-safe state management using Mutex
- Automatic failover to Secondary API
- 200 ms request timeout using Context
- WebSocket telemetry
- Real-time metrics broadcasting
- Dockerized using Multi-stage builds

---

## Circuit Breaker States

The implementation supports all three circuit breaker states.

### CLOSED

- Requests are routed to the Primary API.
- Failure count is monitored.

---

### OPEN

- Triggered after **3 consecutive failures**.
- Primary API is skipped.
- Requests are immediately routed to the Secondary API.

---

### HALF_OPEN

After a 5-second recovery timeout:

- One trial request is sent to the Primary API.
- If successful:
  - Circuit transitions to **CLOSED**
- If unsuccessful:
  - Circuit transitions back to **OPEN**

---

## Frontend (React)

Real-time monitoring dashboard displaying:

- Total Requests
- Active Route
- Circuit Breaker State
- Request Graph
- Transition Log
- Live WebSocket Updates

---

## Telemetry

The backend continuously streams:

- Request Count
- Active Route
- Circuit Breaker State

using WebSockets.

## 🧠 Architectural Choices

### 1. Custom Circuit Breaker State Machine (Golang)
*   **Zero-Dependency Design**: Built entirely from scratch using `sync.Mutex` blocks to enforce total thread safety. This prevents race conditions and ensures that state transitions (`CLOSED` ↔ `OPEN` ↔ `HALF-OPEN`) resolve atomically even under high concurrency.
*   **Context Deadline Enforcement**: A strict `context.WithTimeout(200 * time.Millisecond)` boundary is wrapped around all outbound Primary requests. If the network or upstream drops packets or introduces latency, the runtime instantly cancels the execution loop to avoid cascading component exhaustion.
*   **Time-Based Cooldown Lifecycle**: When consecutive failures cross the threshold of **3**, the breaker transitions to `OPEN` and routes traffic directly to the Secondary API without wasting network bandwidth. Once a time-based cooling window expires, the state machine steps into `HALF-OPEN` on the very next incoming request to issue a single trial probe. A successful result smoothly recovers the circuit back to `CLOSED`.

### 2. High-Frequency Rendering Architecture (React)
*   **Optimized Rendering Pipelines**: The frontend UI leverages high-throughput WebSocket listeners designed to parse real-time server telemetries (RPS, state metrics, active routes) without triggering costly full-component tree re-renders or freezing the browser main execution thread.

### 3. Memory Constraint Engineering
*   **128 MB RAM Envelope**: The Go backend is constrained to a strict `128M` memory layout using Docker kernel `cgroups` limits. To review active runtime stats, execute: `docker stats backend --no-stream`.
*   **Deterministic Garbage Prevention**: Resource leaks are completely avoided by using `defer response.Body.Close()` across all endpoints, ensuring underlying system file descriptors are returned to the platform allocator immediately. Telemetry variables are tracked using pre-allocated structures rather than dynamically appending slices, maintaining a flat memory profile over prolonged stress testing.

### 4. Multi-Stage Docker Builds
*   The Go build matrix uses `CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux` during compilation. This decouples the resulting application from host glibc binaries, producing an ultra-lean, statically linked native execution binary tailored to execute inside minimal `alpine` distribution envelopes safely.

# Chaos Engineering

The project integrates **Toxiproxy** to simulate network failures.

Supported scenarios:

- 500 ms latency
- Packet loss
- Automatic failover
- Recovery verification
